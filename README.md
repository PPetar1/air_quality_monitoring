🌍 Air Quality Data Pipeline

A hands-on data engineering project that demonstrates modern ETL/ELT pipelines using https://docs.openaq.org/about/about. Built to showcase data engineering skills with a production-ready stack using entirely free and open-source tools.


What This Project Is

This is a learning portfolio project that implements a complete data pipeline from extraction to visualization, simulating real-world data engineering scenarios. It focuses on:

    Real data: Live air quality metrics from the OpenAQ API

    Modern stack: Python, Airflow, dbt, Grafana?

    Production patterns: Incremental loads, data quality checks

    Free tools: Everything runs locally or on free cloud tiers


Installation 
 
pip install -r requirements.txt  

You can run individual scripts using python3 scripts/script_name.py  


Project Status

Current Phase: Setup & Initial Extraction  
Next Phase: Transformations with dbt


Note: This project is actively being developed as a learning exercise. The codebase will evolve as features are implemented.
